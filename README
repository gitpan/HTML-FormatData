HTML::FormatData 0.10
=====================

DESCRIPTION

HTML::FormatData contains utility functions to format strings and dates.
These utilities are useful for formatting data to be displayed on webpages,
or for cleaning and date data during server-side validation before storage
in a database or file.

While doing web development work in the past, I noticed that I was having
to do the same operations time and again: strip HTML from form submissions,
truncate strings for display as table data, URI-encode strings for use in
links, translate Unix timestamps into mm/dd/yyyy format, etc. Rather than
try to keep straight the different modules and functions used, I decided to
write a wrapper with a single, consistent interface.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
